#Django Customers

##Rationale
I've created this list for two reasons:

1.  During conversations with **non-developers**, they were shocked to hear that sites they knew (like Instagram & Pinterest) were using FLOSS but NOT contributing to or supporting the project.
2.  While doing some research using a version of the Business Model Canvas, the [Impact Canvas](http://www.socialblueprint.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ISA_The-Social-Blueprint_-Impact-Canvas_v3.21.pdf), a few questions popped out.
    1. Who ARE Django's customers? (I was focusing on Django and the DSF/DEFNA in my research. Substitute your project or organization here)
    2. What is the DSF's relationship WITH those customers?
    3. How does the DSF REACH or INTERACT with those customers?

This list focuses mostly on point 2. If there's GOING to be a business model, you need CLEAR answers to ALL of three of the questions listed there. If you don't know WHO you're doing business with, you're not really in business.

Some quick thinking makes it clear that there are at LEAST two different groups of (commercial) customers, ie "people using Django for business":

-  Large, commercial customers (Instagram, Pinterest, etc)
-  Smaller (1-10 person? Pick a value of *small*) commercial users

Focusing on the larger, commercial customers, I'm *starting* a list of "large" users of Django (with 'large' NOT being well defined at the moment). The goal is to start identifying customers and figuring out what kind of relationship the DSF does or can have with them, and how to create a value exchange based ON that relationship. There may be things I'm NOT aware of, but as far as I know now, the relationship is:
>  Customers: We download [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and use it.
>  DSF: We update, maintain and upload [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), so people can download and use it.

There's no business model there. Identifying the customers more clearly makes it possible to identify spaces for value creation. You can't give a stranger what they want. You don't KNOW what they want. Because they're a stranger.

##Going forward
This isn't intended to be a complete or exhaustive list, it's TWO things:

-  A starting point, as far as listing significant customers of Django
-  A starting point, as far as thinking about CUSTOMERS of project. Who are they? What do they want/need? How can we provide it AND capture some of the value?
